## Requirements
- **Docker:** You only need docker and docker compose.

## How To Run?

### To run and go through the project
```shell
git clone https://github.com/zim0101/authvault.git
```
```shell
docker compose up --build -d
```

### For development:

Clone the repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/zim0101/authvault.git
```

Get into the repository
```shell
cd authvault
```
Change the .env.example to .env
```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

Before running the application, update your .env file with the following environment variables. 
Make sure to use an appropriate database name and, most importantly, 
choose a strong password! ðŸš¨ Don't forget: .env should always remain in .gitignoreâ€”never commit sensitive information!

Many of the variables below come with default values. However, you'll need to customize certain fields according 
to your setup:

* **Database:** Update `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_DB`, and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` with your database credentials.
* **Server Port:** Modify the `SERVER_PORT` as needed. 
* **Encryption Key:** Set a strong `ENCRYPTION_SECRET_KEY` for secure data encryption.
* **OAuth Credentials:** Get your Google and GitHub client IDs and secrets from their respective developer accounts and 
  fill them in `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`.
```
APPLICATION_NAME=AuthVault
ENCRYPTION_SECRET_KEY=MySecretKey12345
SERVER_PORT=5000
SPRING_DATASOURCE_HOST=postgres-db
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_DB=authvault_db
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://${SPRING_DATASOURCE_HOST}:${POSTGRES_PORT}/${POSTGRES_DB}
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
```
You will also have a ```application-dev.properties``` file. Use this file only for development.

Run the project
```shell
docker compose up --build -d
```

After changing the source code or adding new features, build the spring boot app.
```shell
docker compose build authvault-app
```

And finally run the project
```shell
docker compose up
```

Now open your browser and visit: ```http://localhost:5000/``` or replace the port with the one you used in `.env`

## Logs
```shell
docker compose logs authvault-app
```
